This aerodrome (Hosur airport) is located about 100km South of Bengaluru Kempegowda Airport - VOBL.

Hosur airport has a special attachment with me , because this was the birth place for my interest in aviation.
I still remember the day when I was taken on a field trip in Middle School to this aerodrome :)

So as to start my scenery development journey to give back to the fg community I decided that Hosur Should be the first one.
